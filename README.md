# CO2_GHG_Emission

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to our group project focused on analyzing CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions data. In this collaborative effort, a team of five individuals will explore a comprehensive dataset provided by Our World in Data. This dataset contains key metrics related to CO2 emissions, greenhouse gases, energy mix, and other relevant factors.

## 2. Dataset Source
This is a group project with five members.
The file consists of a presentation slide deck, 3 tabluau workbooks, and 2 csv data sourse file.
The "CO2_Global" and "CO2_Singapore" uses the "owid-co2-data.csv", which is retrieved from https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/owid-public/data/co2/owid-co2-data.csv
The "CO2_ASEAN" uses "asean.csv", which does some filtering based on the above data source.

## 3. Project Goals
The primary objective of our project is to delve into this dataset and conduct a comprehensive analysis of CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. Through data exploration and visualization, we aim to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and factors driving these emissions. Our goal is to contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discourse surrounding climate change and environmental sustainability.
